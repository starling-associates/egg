<h3 align='center'>Starling Egg is a Grasshopper template geared towards project collaboration.</h3>



**Starling Egg** consists of a reference document and a Rhino + Grasshopper template.

The reference document describes how to start a new Grasshopper script, how to connect to the internal and packages, and how to visually organise and annotate the Grasshopper definition, so that it is easy to read, reusable and open for further development and changes.

The Grasshopper Template is a part of every Grasshopper project. It guides the workflows of the designer as the Grasshopper definition is being created.

## Authors

**Starling Egg** is an open-source project by [Starling Associates](https://www.starling.associates "Starling Associates website").

Starling is a spatial insight, strategy and design bureau that develops regenerative and lively environments with a net-positive impact on our future. We embrace the beautiful complexity of our planet’s ecosystems and use a systemic approach to sustainability, circularity and nature-inclusiveness. We go well beyond the life cycle of the places we design and aim to foster the cycle of life that flows through them. Therefore, we develop innovative instruments that are inspired by natural principles and allow us to generate a deep understanding of the environment. We utilise these constantly evolving insights to develop strategies and designs that serve people, society, economy and the ecologies in which they reside in harmony.
