Making sketches on your script can be a useful visual solution. In a huge script, it will be easier to refer to particular parts in your construction. The first step is to create a sketch object. The second step is to import the whole .dwg file to Rhino and export it to a Grasshopper script. It can be for example the whole bridge or just a small cross-section where you can refer to your script. With extra arrows, you can show which part of the structure refers to which part of the script so that itâ€™s easier for your colleagues to work in your script.
