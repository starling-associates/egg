**Starling Egg is a Grasshopper template geared towards project collaboration.**

Starling Egg is a Grasshopper template that has been specifically designed for project collaboration. This template allows multiple designers to work together on a single Grasshopper definition, making it ideal for projects where a team-based approach is required.

One of the key features of Starling Egg is its ability to manage version control. With this template, each designer can work on a separate branch of the Grasshopper definition, making changes and testing new ideas without affecting the work of other team members. Once a design element has been finalized, it can be merged back into the main branch of the definition, ensuring that all team members are working with the latest version of the design.

Another important feature of Starling Egg is its ability to support communication and collaboration between team members. The template includes a range of tools for commenting on design elements, discussing design decisions, and sharing information with other team members. This makes it easier for team members to work together effectively, even if they are located in different parts of the world.

In addition, Starling Egg includes a range of components that can be used to create complex geometries, define materials and textures, and generate detailed reports and documentation. These components are designed to be flexible and adaptable, so that they can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of a design project.

Overall, Starling Egg is a powerful and flexible tool that can help design teams to work more efficiently and effectively. Whether you are working on a large-scale architectural project or a smaller design project, this template is sure to be a valuable asset in your design toolkit.

**Starling Egg** consists of a reference document and a Rhino + Grasshopper template.

The reference document describes how to start a new Grasshopper script, how to connect to the internal and packages, and how to visually organise and annotate the Grasshopper definition, so that it is easy to read, reusable and open for further development and changes.

The Grasshopper Template is a part of every Grasshopper project. It guides the workflows of the designer as the Grasshopper definition is being created.

Starling Associates has developed a powerful Rhino Grasshopper template system that can help designers streamline their workflow and improve the quality of their designs. This template system includes a set of pre-built Grasshopper components that can be easily customized and adapted to fit the specific needs of a design project.

The template system includes a variety of components that can be used to create complex geometries, apply materials and textures, define lighting and camera settings, and generate documentation and reports. The system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a user-friendly interface that allows designers to quickly and easily navigate through the various components.

One of the key features of the Starling Associates template system is its focus on modularity and flexibility. The components can be easily combined and reconfigured to create new designs, and they can be adapted to work with different types of input data and design parameters.

Another important feature of the template system is its emphasis on sustainability and energy efficiency. The components include a range of tools and techniques for optimizing designs and reducing energy consumption, making it an ideal choice for architects, engineers, and designers who are committed to creating sustainable and environmentally-friendly designs.

Overall, the Rhino Grasshopper template system developed by Starling Associates is a powerful and versatile tool that can help designers to create high-quality, innovative designs more efficiently and effectively. Whether you are working on a small-scale project or a large-scale architectural design, this template system is sure to be a valuable asset in your design toolkit.
