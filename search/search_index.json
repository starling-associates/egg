Whether you are working on a large-scale architectural project or a smaller design project, this template is sure to be a valuable asset in your design toolkit. In general, it can offer several benefits to designers:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Collaboration. This template allows multiple designers to work together on a single Grasshopper definition, making it ideal for projects where a team-based approach is required.</p> </li> <li> <p>Streamlined Workflow. By using a pre-configured template, designers can save time and effort in setting up their project. This allows them to focus on their design process and iterate faster.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistent Organisation. The templates helps to maintain consistency across multiple projects or within a team. They help in organizing complex scripts and algorithms in a more structured manner, making it easier to understand and modify.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quality Assurance. By using a well-designed template, designers can ensure that their designs meet certain quality standards and avoid common mistakes. This can lead to better overall outcomes and increased efficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customization. Templates can be tailored to a designer's specific needs and preferences, providing a personalized starting point for each project.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Customize the template to fit your needs: The Starling Egg template is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so you can customize it to fit the specific needs of your project. You can add new components, modify existing ones, and create your own tools and workflows.</p> <p>Starling Egg consists of a reference document and a Rhino + Grasshopper template.</p> <p>The reference document describes how to start a new Grasshopper script, how to connect to the internal and packages, and how to visually organise and annotate the Grasshopper definition, so that it is easy to read, reusable and open for further development and changes.</p> <p>The Grasshopper Template is a part of every Grasshopper project. It guides the workflows of the designer as the Grasshopper definition is being created.</p> <p></p> <p>Starling Egg is an open-source project initiated by Starling Associates and Scape Agency.</p>"},{"location":"quick_start/","title":"Quick Start","text":"<p>To get up and running with Starling Egg follow these instructions:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Download. \u2013 Download the latest release of the Starling Egg template files from our repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open. \u2013 Open the Starling Egg template in Grasshopper.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"about/acknowledgements/","title":"Acknowledgements","text":""},{"location":"about/acknowledgements/#documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"<p>The structure of this documentation is based on the Di\u00e1taxis framework for technical documentation authoring.</p>"},{"location":"about/acknowledgements/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>The example is based on the following academic papers:</p> <ul> <li>https://geometrymatters.com/the-shape-of-a-perfect-egg-defined-by-a-universal-formula/</li> <li>https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.14680</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/acknowledgements/#umwelt","title":"Umwelt","text":"<p>During the development of Starling Egg, we've built upon the following articles:</p> <ul> <li>https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/grasshopper-best-practices/86120</li> <li>TU Delft | Grasshopper \"Good Practice\"</li> <li>Modelical | Grasshopper best practices</li> <li>Parametric by Design | Best Practices</li> <li>BIM Corner | 15 Rhino TIPS while working with Grasshopper</li> <li>BIM Corner | 5 Grasshopper tricks to defeat spaghetti monster</li> <li>Syntegrate | How to Improve the Readability of Grasshopper Scripts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/authors/","title":"Authors","text":"<p>Starling Egg is an open-source project by Starling Associates and Scape Agency.</p>"},{"location":"about/authors/#starling-associates","title":"Starling Associates","text":"<p>Starling is a spatial insight, strategy and design bureau that develops regenerative and lively environments with a net-positive impact on our future.

To avoid this, we insist that you credit the authors for parts of your Grasshopper definitions you did not make.</p> <p>Grasshopper Forum</p> <p>The Mcneel Rhinoceros forums Grasshopper is supported with a Forum that uses an open-platform ideology which means that many definitions are used and shared across the world. The forum can be a useful way to solve technical problems with your Grasshopper definitions. When you ask questions and/or upload definitions, usually somebody responds and offers help. If somebody on the forum fixed a part of your definition, you need to identify the portion of the definition which the person altered, credit the author and list the date when this occured.</p> <p>Plugins and User Components</p> <p>Plugins can be found at Food4Rhino.com Accross the forum and on personal blogs or webpages, you will find many plug-ins and/or user components. These are either clusters or scripts (VB, Python, or C#) made by individuals who deserve credit when you are using them. List the author, the URL where you've retrieved them from and list the date when this occured.</p> <p>How to Credit Authors</p> <p>Crediting an Author, from Cosmatu, 2014 \"Unroll Surface and Breps\" For TU Delft purposes, we define a standard method for crediting authors. If you fail to comply with this and your instructors notice that you are using definitions that are not your own, you will be subject to further examining.</p> <p>Following the example in the image on the right, group the part of the definition (or user component) and define the group color as white. Underneath you will place panel (also colored white) that outlines all necessary information.</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/dependencies/","title":"Dependencies","text":"<p>Grasshopper relies on two types of dependencies: </p> <ol> <li>External Geometry: References geometry declared in Rhino, and </li> <li>External Components: External plugins used within Grasshopper. </li> </ol> <p>In general, it is best practice to keep dependencies to a very minimum. Especially, when working on a project with several people and over a longer period of time.</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/dependencies/#external-geometry","title":"External Geometry","text":"<p>Referencing geometric objects from Rhino with a Grasshopper container is convenient at first, but it requires that the Rhino file is always opened in parallel. Also, the referenced geometry must not be deleted in Rhino; otherwise the connection is lost. The problem is that there is no hint in Rhino that an object is needed by an algorithm. To bypass the problem, at least for simple shapes, it\u2019s possible to right-click the container in Grasshopper and select Internalise data. Now the object is saved within the Grasshopper file. If this is not an option, the referenced geometry should be on an extra layer, have another color or the filename should indicate the dependency.</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/dependencies/#external-components","title":"External Components","text":"<p>Other dependencies are components that are made available by external plugins for Grasshopper. Using one of them also requires all persons to have the same plugin installed when they\u2019re opening the file. Also be aware that there are rare cases in which plugins are not backwards compatible.</p> <p>Before using a dependency, you should question yourself, if a plugin offers a unique feature and if it justifies the extra load. If a component from a plugin is used, because it offers a shortcut to replace two or three built-in components, then it\u2019s better to use what\u2019s already available. Also, there are plugins that offer similar features, for example to work with meshes. Here, stick with the components from one plugin and try not to mix them.</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/geometry_pipeline/","title":"Geometry Pipeline","text":"<p>How many times have you lost your referred geometry in Rhino to a Grasshopper? Whenever you would like to update your dwg file, you need to do a referring job manually. For example, when you update the road line in your project after some modifications, every time you have to right-click on the curve primitive component and click <code>Set on curve</code>. A thankless job, especially with many objects in Rhino. </p> <p>But I have good news! There is a built-in Grasshopper solution to help you with that. If you haven\u2019t already heard and used the <code>Geometry Pipeline</code> component, you should start doing it right now! You can find it under param ribbon and geometry. </p> <p>Geometry Pipeline The geometry pipeline is a link to the opened Rhino model, which lets you auto-reference any geometry. It transfers your geometry into Grasshopper, based on type (point, curve, brep and meshes). Moreover, it is possible to filter geometry based on the names of the objects and layers names. And you can do that even with hidden and locked objects.</p> <p>As a default under layer and name, an asterisk is set up. It means that absolute every object\u2019s Name and Layer will be piped through the component. In other words, you can automatically select and chose all points or curves that exist in the Rhino file.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s go into a practical example\u2026</p> <p>If you would like to filter one specific layer, type the layer\u2019s full name into the component. Note that the filter notations are case sensitive, so it is essential to write precisely characters with small or big letters. OK, but what if you need all layers that start with the ? Nothing hard. Just put an asterisk after your main name part, and the component will filter the rest for you. Furthermore, you can be more precise and use after your main text a question mark to specify any single character in this place or hashtag to grab just digits (0-9). To show you how does it work. Let\u2019s assume that we have four layers called Roadline 1, Roadline 2, Roadline A, Roadline B. Writing in filter a command filters just layers Roadline 1 and Roadline 2.</p> <p>Whole list with regular expressions how to use them in Geometry Pipeline you can find below.</p> <p>Referenced Geomometry</p> <p>Referenced geometry Referenced Geometry is the geometry that is defined in Rhino and important into Grasshopper by using Set Geometry options. These can be either points, curves, surfaces, breps, boxes, meshes, groups, etc. Geometry can be defined in Rhino as well in Grasshopper. This difference will dictate the possibility of changing the geometry later in Rhino and not only in Grasshopper. This will influence the design process and the capacity to effectively altering your design geometry. If the content of the parameters is defined in Grasshopper, the options of modifying the geometry in Rhino itself will be lost. If however the content of the parameter is based on Rhino geometry the geometry can be altered in Rhino resulting in a modifica</p>"},{"location":"best_practices/introduction/","title":"Best Practices","text":"<p>This page contains a collection of advice and guidelines for visual programming in Grasshopper that will help you to become a better designer.

In order to close viewports, Right Click on the view and click <code>Close Viewport</code>.</p> <p>To create extra views, go to View\u2192 Viewport layout \u2192 New Viewport. If a new window appeared on your screen, it is time to go in the Named View section. But first, make sure that you have turned on Panel called &lt;&lt; Named Views &gt;&gt;. You can do that in options on your toolbox to the right or at the top in Panels. Everything now is prepared to click save and use your view. Every time now, you can just come back to your view with just one click.</p> <p>The cherry on top. When you work with several screens, you can grab your whole view and move it to another screen. To do that, catch your view and move it outside your view windows.

In a huge script, it will be easier to refer to particular parts in your construction. </p> <p>The first step is to create a sketch object. The second step is to import the whole .dwg file to Rhino and export it to a Grasshopper script. It can be for example the whole bridge or just a small cross-section where you can refer to your script. With extra arrows, you can show which part of the structure refers to which part of the script so that it\u2019s easier for your colleagues to work in your script.</p> <p>Sketch in Grasshopper Draw function in Grasshopper is not the best one I have ever seen. My created lines are always ugly, and it is impossible to make a straight line.</p> <p>However, making sketches on your script can be a helpful visual solution thanks to the function called \u2013 load from Rhino. Just right click on the sketched line and choose Load from Rhino. If your Rhino geometry is placed near zero points, then imported geometry in Grasshopper will be placed in the top left corner on the canvas. You can import frames, lines or even huge text visible for everyone in a big script.</p> <p>More than that, you can import whole dwg drawings.
